Project for the System Programming exam at Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at University of Camerino.

The goal of the project is to implement the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm using a dynamic programming approach.



# Executing
The program take in inut the 3 paths ( absolute or relative) containing a file:

1.The first file to be compared;

2.The second file to be compared;

3.The path of the file where the Longest Common Subsequence will be written;
